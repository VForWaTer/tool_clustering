    title: Clustering
    description: | 
      Apply one of the available clustering algorithms. All implementations
      use SciKit-Learn (cite reference here).
      All algorithms take in a data matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features).
    version: 0.1
    parameters:
      method:
        type: enum
        values:
          - kmeans
          - mean_shift
          - affinity_propagation
          - agglomerative_single
          - agglomerative_ward
          - agglomerative_complete
          - agglomerative_average
      data:
        type: file
        description: | 
          Pass a csv or dat file containing the data for clustering.
          The input matrix needs the shape (n_samples, n_features).
          In case there is only one feature, the tool will transform the
          data into the correct shape (n_samples, 1)
      n_clusters:
        type: integer
        description: Number of clusters to form. Will be ignored by Mean Shift and Affinity Propagation
      random_state:
        type: integer
        description: Number to seed stochastic clustering algorithms. Will be ignored by Mean Shift and the Agglomerative algorithms.
      init_args:
        type: struct
        description: |
          Optional struct containing extra arguments for initialization of the
          clustering algorithm. The selected clustering algorithm needs to accept
          the parameters. Refer to SciKit-Learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster
